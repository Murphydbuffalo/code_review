# Pick Partners for Code Review

+ Globally install babel with `npm install -g babel`
+ Run `babel-node pairing.js ` followed by a space separated list of names and the script will randomly partner everyone up. Odd numbers of people are fine.
+ Running `npm start` will run the pairing script with the names Dan Dave Richard and Maria passed in.
